<p>This module resembles the drop module, except that only LineSegments may be dropped by dropGenerator, and that these segments  are dropped in such a way as to extend an already existing tree. In this mode, illustrated by the dandelion image just above, the current state consists of a set of trees (a forest) of segments. Each segment in the forest is either interior, meaning that its <span class = "textVar">end1</span> has been continued by one or more segments, or terminal, meaning that there is no continuing segment emerging from its <span class = "textVar">end1</span>.</p>
<p> Here is an explanation of the parameters:</p>
<p class="indent"> First, parameters to the main  algorithm:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class = "textVar">dropTries:number</span> : if this number of consectutive drops fail due to collision, terminate the algorithm.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class = "textVar">maxDrops:number</span>: the maximum number of drop trials</p>
<p class="indent"><span class = "textVar">doNotExit:circle or rectangle</span>: reject drops any of whose segments straddle the inside and outside of the given geometric figure</p>
<p class="indent"> Next, parameters to <span class = "textVar">generateFan</span>:</p>
<p class="indent"> Note <span class = "userDefinedText">generateDrop</span>, relies on generateFan to do its work:</p>
<preUserDefinedCode>
rs.dropAt = function (p) {
  return this.generateFan(Object.assign({startingPoint:p},fanParams));
}
</precode>

<p class="indent"><span class = "textVar">generateFan</span>  extends the tree by either one or two segments (controlled by <span class = "textVar">splitChance</span>).  The segments, in either case, emanate from <span class = "textVar">startingPoint</span>, which will be a terminal node of the existing tree. In the latter case, it produces a branching of the tree, and in the former case not. Parameters to <span class = "textVar">generateFan</span> are:</p>
<p class="indent"> <span class = "textVar">segLength:number</span>: the length of segments dropped.</p>
<p class="indent"> <span class = "textVar">lineP:shape</span>: the prototype to use for the visible lines generated (the shapes in the dropStruct) </p>
<p class="indent"> <span class = "textVar">startingPoint:Point</span>: the position of the terminal node to be extened. </p>
<p class="indent"> <span class = "textVar">extendWhich:string</span>: which of the terminal nodes to extend. Possible values 'first', meaning the earliest added terminal node that has not yet been extended, 'random' meaning a randomly selected terminal node, and 'last' meaning the last added terminal node.</p>
<p class="indent"> <span class = "textVar">sepNext</span>: the separation between the terminal node and the new segment(s)</p>
<p class="indent"> <span class = "textVar">splitChance</span>: the chance that a split (two segments) rather than a linear continuation (one segment), will be chosen.</p>
<p class="indent"> <span class = "textVar">splitAmount</span>: if a split is chosen, the angular difference between the two new segments.</p>
<p class="indent"> <span class = "textVar">directionChange</span>: the direction of the new segment, or center of the new branch, relative to the terminal segment being extended</p>
<p class="indent"> <span class = "textVar">randomDirectionChange</span>: a random value to be added to directionChange is chosen at random from the interval [<span class = "textVar">[-randomDirectionChange,randomDirectionChange]</span>]</p>
<!--<p class="indent"> <span class = "textVar">lineExt</span>: the amount by which lineSegments should be extended to produce lines in the dropStruct. </p>-->
<p class="indent"> <span class = "textVar">stroke</span>: self-explanatory </p>
<p class="indent"> <span class = "textVar">strokeWidth</span>: self-explanatory </p>

<p class="indent"> Note that <span class = "textVar">initialDrop</span> relies on <span class = "textVar">ringSeeds</span> to do  its work:</p>
<precode>

rs.initialDrop = function () {
  let rad  = 0.15 * 0.5 * this.width;
  return this.ringSeeds(ringParams);  
}

</precode>
<p> <span class = "textVar">ringSeeds</span> returns a dropStruct: [array of lineSegment,array of shape]. In this case the elements of dropStruct play the role of seeds for starting the construction of a tree, thence the name.  Like <span class = "textVar">generateFan, ringSeeds</span> takes its parameters first from its argument, and then from <span class = "textVar">this</span>. The parameters to <span class = "textVar">ringSeeds</span> are:</p>

<p class="indent"> <span class = "textVar">numSeeds:number</span>: <span class = "textVar">ringSeeds</span> generates a ring of outwardly directed segments, evenly placed around a ring. <span class = "textVar">numSeeds</span> is their count. </p>
<p class="indent"> <span class = "textVar">segLength:number</span>: the length of segments dropped.</p>
<p class="indent"> <span class = "textVar">lineP:shape</span>: the prototype to use for the visible lines generated (the shapes in the dropStruct) </p>
<p class="indent"> <span class = "textVar">ringRadius:number</span>: self-explanatory </p>
