<p class="title">Conventions</p>
<p class="section">Types</p>
<p> In these documents, I will use the notation exemplified below to indicate the types of functions:</p>
<pre style="padding-left:20px;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold" class="code">
nd.set(name:string,shp:shape) => shape
</pre></span>

<p>This means that the first argument to the method <span class="textVar">nd.set</span> is meant to be a <span class="textVar">string</span>, and the second a <span class="textVar">shape</span>, and that the output is a <span class="textVar">shape</span>. The variable names <span class="textVar">nm</span> and <span class="textVar">shp</span> serve only as a way to reference the arguments in subsequent text, and have no other significance. The types string and shape are not formal, but rather informal names of a kinds of JavaScript values. Of course JavaScript is not a statically typed language, so you will see
things like </p>

<pre style="padding-left:20px;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold" class="code">
nd.set('a',shp);
</pre>

<p>in code, but never the types.</p>
<p class="section">User-Defined Methods</p>

<p> In each of the image generation modules, many methods will be defined by the module, but some need to be defined by the user.  For example, in the grid module, <span class="textVar">generateGrid</span> is defined by the module, but <span class="userDefinedText">shapeGenerator</span>  should be defined by the user. The latter sort of method will appear in <span style="color:rgb(200,0,0)">red</span>.</p>

<p class="section">Top-level Image Generation Functions</p>


<p> In each case, the top-level generation functions are named <span class="textVar">generate&lt;Whatever&gt;</span>, for example, generateGrid, generateWeb, and generateDrop.
