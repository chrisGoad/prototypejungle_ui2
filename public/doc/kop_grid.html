</pre><p>The main image generator calls the user defined JavaScript method shapeGenerator(gridCoordinates:Point,randomValues:Object). This  returns a shape. Its second,optional, argument is a  vector of random values which have been precomputed for the given grid point by the smooth bounded random value generator. This generator, given max, min, and step parameters for each member of the vector, computes values for each grid point which differ from neighbors by no more than step, and which lie within the given min and max values. Thus grid images can be generated populated by arbitrary shapes, whose attributes can be made to vary smoothly over the grid. </p>
<p> A second user defined method is boundaryLineGenerator(gridCoordinates:Point,randomValues:Object,end0:Point,end1:Point). This method returns a shape which represents one of the four boundaries of the cell, the one with the given end points. Thus the boundary lines as well as the occupants of grid cells can be depicted in the way that the coder sees fit.</p>
