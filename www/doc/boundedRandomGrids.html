 <p>The principal methods of <a href="/mlib/boundedRandomGrids.mjs">this module<a> create grids of random numbers, which are constrained to vary by only so much per step in the x or y directions, and to lie within given bounds. That is, they create  smooth, bounded surfaces, as it were. The details:
There are two principal routines:</p>

<p>this.setupRandomGridForShapes(nm,params) where</p>
<p>nm is of type string - the name of the grid</p>
<p>and  params has the form {step:<number>,min:<number>,max:<number>)</p>
<p>step is the maximum amount that the random value can vary in one step of x or y on the grid. 
It is assumed that this has properties numRows and numCols; a bounded random grid of this size is produced.</p>

<p>this.setupRandomGridForBoundaries(nm,params) is the same, except that a random grid of dimensions this.numRows+1 and this.numCols+1 is produced 

<p>When several such grids, named, say a,b,c  have been setup by setupRandomGridForShapes , 
they are used to produce the rvs  argument  to shapeGenerator in the grid module. Specifically, shapeGenerator will be called, for each grid cell, with rvs set to {a:<va>,b:<vb>,c:<vc>} where va,vb, and vc are the values at the given cell in the grids that have been setup by the calls</p>
<p>this.setupRandomGridForShapes('a',params); </p>
<p>this.setupRandomGridForShapes('b',params);</p>
<p>this.setupRandomGridForShapes('c',params); </p>

<p>Similarly, this.setupRandomGridForBoundaris(nm,params) sets up grids which are used to produce the rvs argument to boundaryLineGenerator.</p>
