<p class="title">Type Notation</p>
<p> In these documents, I will use the notation exemplified below to indicate the types of functions:</p>
<precode>
nd.set(name:string,shp:shape) => shape
</precode></span>

<p>This means that the first argument to the method <span class="textVar">nd.set</span> is meant to be a <span class="textVar">string</span>, and the second a <span class="textVar">shape</span>, and that the output is a <span class="textVar">shape</span>. The variable names <span class="textVar">nm</span> and <span class="textVar">shp</span> serve only as a way to reference the arguments in subsequent text, and have no other significance. The types string and shape are not formal, but rather informal names of a kinds of JavaScript values. Of course JavaScript is not a statically typed language, so you will see
things like </p>

<precode>
nd.set('a',shp);
</precode>

in code, but never the types.
