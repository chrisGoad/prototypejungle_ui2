<p class="title">Lines</p>

<p> The main image generator, generateLines(geom1:geometricObject,geom2:geometricObject,numLines), chooses a random point on/in geom1 and another random point  on geom2, and connects the two by a visible line segment. It does thin numLiness times. The geometric objects may be circles, rectangles, or line segments. In the case of circles and rectangles, the interior may or may not be included. generateLines may called repeatedly with different arguments.
