<p class="title">Webs</p>

<p> The main image generator, generateWeb(points:array of Point,params:{minConnectorLength:number,maxConnectorLength:number)), successively chooses pairs of points at random from the given points array, which are more distant from each other than minConnectorLength, and less distant than maxConnectorLength. Then it connects them with a visible line segment, if that segment does no intersect any line segment previously drawn.
