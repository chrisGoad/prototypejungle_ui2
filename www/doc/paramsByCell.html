<p class="title">paramsByCell</p>

<p> This module will be introduced, as usual, via annotated code, which generates the image</p>
 <p><img  src="/images/grid_void.jpg?alt=media" style="bborder:thin black solid;cursor:pointer"  width="400" height="400" max-height="500"/></p>
 <p>First, here's a simplified variant of the  code, which generates</p>

<p> We've seen this all before except for the lines: </p>
<precode>

let pbc  = {
  widthFactor:1,
  heightFactor:1,
  maxSizeFactor:3,
  sizePower:2,
  sizeMap:  {0:1,1:1,2:2,3:4},
  colorMap: 
    {
      0:`rgba(${255},0,0,0)`,
      1:`rgba(${255},0,0,0.4)`,
      2:`rgba(255,255,255,0.4)`,
      3:`rgba(0,0,0,1)`,

<p> <span class="textVar">paramsByCell(cell)</span> returns a particular way of computing the size, color, and prototype to be used for the shape which will populate the given cell. There is a sizeMap for sizes and a colorMap for colors. These maps take as input the largest power of sizePower which occurs as factor in both of the cell's coordinates.  Call the largest power of n which occurs as a factor of a number its n-regularity.  Then odd numbers have 2-regularity 0 because they are not multiples of any power of 2. Numbers of the form 2*&lt;odd-number&gt; have regularity 1 because they have a factor which is 2**1. Numbers of the form 4*&lt;odd-number&gt; have 2-regularity 2 because they are multiples of 2**2. And so on. Here is a 2-regularity table for numbers up to 16:
<precode>
input         0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16
2-regularity  0  0  1  0  2  0  1  0  3  0   1  0  2  0  1  0  4
</precode>
<p>The 2-regularity of a cell is the minimum of the regularity of its x coordinate, and the regularity of its y coordinate. Perhaps now you can see how the image immediately above was generated. Regularity 0 cells are populated by small red opaque rectangles. Regularity 1 cells are populated by small red rectangles of opacity 0.5. Regularity 2 cells are  populated by larger white rectangles. Finally, regularity 3 cells are populated by even larger black rectangles.</p>
<p> To generate the final image, we need to adjust widthFactor and heightFactor so that they go to zero near the center.</p>
 <p class="title"><img  src="/images/grid_void.jpg?alt=media" style="bborder:thin black solid;cursor:pointer"  width="300" height="300" max-height="500"/></p>

<p>This is done by the following code:</p>

<precode>
rs.paramsByCell = function (cell) {
  let {numRows,numCols,rectP} = this;
  let {x,y} = cell;
  let cx = numCols/2;
  let cy = numRows/2;
  // {x:cx,y:cy} are coordinates of center
  let maxd = Math.sqrt(cx*cx + cy*cy);
  let xdc = x - cx;
  let ydc = y - cy;
  let cd = Math.sqrt(xdc*xdc + ydc*ydc); // distande from center
  let df = cd/maxd; //fractional distance from center; 1 = far as possible; 0 = at center
  let yf = y/numRows;
  let wf =  1.3* df;
  pbc.widthFactor = wf;
  pbc.heightFactor = wf;
  pbc.shapeProto = rectP;
  return pbc;
}
</precode>
<p> As a final, touch, a largish black square is added at the center by the following modified initializer: </p>
	<precode>
rs.initialize = function () {
  this.initProtos();
  this.addBackground();
  this.generateGrid();
  let rect = this.set('rect',this.rectP.instantiate()).show();
  let rdim = 10;
  rect.width = rdim;
  rect.height = rdim;
  rect.fill = 'black';
  this.addFrame();
}
	</precode>
